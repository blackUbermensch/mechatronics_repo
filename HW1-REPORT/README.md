 - HW 1: Introduction to LabVIEWâ„¢. Comparison of DAC and ADC program. Handout of FPGA and microprocessor hardware (Arduino Mega) and requirements for the semester (electronics kit and laboratory notebooks).
 - HW 2: Update on installation of drivers for myRIO. Generation of myRIO sawtooth generator (simple). Hardware PWM exercise. Homework is to transfer data from myRIO to a program in the host using a network published variable. 

 - Write short report on installation and implementation issues with the myRIO. Install the Arduino IDE and verify operation by running the basic examples.
