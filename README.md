# MEGR7222-MECHATRONICS(SPRING2021)
## Course Description:
The course will include readings that you are expected to review before class, live (and recorded) class sessions and post-class homework assignments. The “in-class” meeting location/time will depend on whether we are in hybrid or online-only mode.
Lectures will recap key concepts, work through problems, and allow for general discussion and questions. These class sessions are intended to elaborate on and supplement the course materials.


## Course Objectives:
This course will build upon a typical laboratory-based Instrumentation class. However, projects undertaken in this stream will be open-ended and sessions will be interactive. 
All students are advised to take the on-line tutorials outlined in the ‘On-line resources’ section of this document (for example the FPGA is available on http://www.ni.com/tutorial/14532/en/#toc1 ), Arduino, and general C-based programming.
The major learning objectives of this course include;
  - To be able to explain the major hardware components of a mechatronic process. 
  - Implementation of a complete process for control and monitoring of a mechanical system.
  - To be able to design electrical circuits for sensor signal conditioning and actuation of mechanical hardware.
  - To connect hardware sequentially from actuators and sensors to a computer and develop hardware to control the process.
  - To understand different types of data acquisition hardware and be able to generate software programs for data translation and control.
 
## Course Topics:
Lecture and workshop sequence is listed below. These will be hands-on and take place in the workshop with practical exercises to be completed following each lecture.
  - Engineering process overview. (Draw a closed loop system diagram for a piezoelectically actuated translation stage)
  - Introduction to Labview™ and DAQ systems. (Write a program to generate, read, and record data to a spreadsheet file).
  - Programing loops in Labview™. (expand the DAQ express to its constituent parts and arrange icons, determine the speed of the loop)
  - Study of a closed loop controlled positioning system. (construction of opto-sensor electronics and calibration)
  - Real-time systems (the while loop).
  - Real-time systems cont’d.
  - Real time systems RIO  and introduction to Arduino/Chipkit (stepper motor control using easy driver)
  - Arduino wireless communication using xbee and/or bluetooth (remote stepper motor control). Photon over WiFi.
  - DC motor control with encoder feedback. (construct power amplifier and AB encoder reader using either Arduino or RIO)
  - Major project. (Group activity constructing closed loop position control or process of your own choice)

## Final Project: 
Design of a Self-Balancing Two Wheeled Automatic Vehicle
